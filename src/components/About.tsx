              Hi! I'm a passionate engineering student from Bangalore, pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My fascination with the cosmos isn't just a hobbyâ€”it's the driving force behind my dream to launch my own space technology company. My journey is a blend of creativity and technology. As a 3D modeler and animator, I bring ideas to life, while my coding skills help me solve real-world problems. I thrive on learning, experimenting, and collaborating on innovative ideas.
